1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,009
picture this a machine that could

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:07,290
organize your cupboard just as you like

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:10,019
it or serve every member of the house a

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,750
customized cup of coffee makes your day

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,929
easier doesn't it these are the products

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,000
of artificial intelligence but why use

7
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:20,220
the term artificial intelligence

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,570
well these machines are artificially

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,359
incorporated with human-like

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:27,480
intelligence to perform tasks as we do

11
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,939
this intelligence is built using complex

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,540
algorithms and mathematical functions

13
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:36,809
but AI may not be as obvious as in the

14
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:39,270
previous examples in fact AI is used in

15
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:42,360
smartphones cars social media feeds

16
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:45,629
video games banking surveillance and

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,899
many other aspects of our daily life the

18
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:51,510
real question is what does an AI do at

19
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:54,210
its core here is a robot we built in our

20
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,190
lab which is now dropped onto a field in

21
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,620
spite of a variation in lighting

22
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:02,010
landscape and dimensions of the field

23
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,710
the AI robot must perform as expected

24
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,320
this ability to react appropriately to a

25
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:10,409
new situation is called generalized

26
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:14,130
learning the robot is now at a crossroad

27
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:16,320
one that is paved in the other rocky the

28
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,439
robot must determine which path to take

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,110
based on the circumstances this portrays

30
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,840
the robots reasoning ability after a

31
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,720
short stroll the robot now encounters a

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,720
stream that it cannot swim across using

33
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,630
the plank provided as an input the robot

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,630
is able to cross this stream so our

35
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,509
robot uses the given input and finds the

36
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,210
solution for a problem this is problem

37
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,640
solving these three capabilities make

38
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,549
the robot artificially intelligent in

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,210
short AI provides machines with the

40
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:54,750
capability to adapt reason and provide

41
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:57,149
solutions well now that we know what a

42
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:00,570
is let's have a look at the two broad

43
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:04,500
categories in AI is classified into weak

44
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:08,310
AI also called narrow AI focuses solely

45
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:11,220
on one task for example alphago is a

46
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,720
maestro of the game go but you can't

47
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:18,170
expect it to be even remotely good at

48
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:20,900
this makes alphago a weak AI you might

49
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:24,500
say Alexa is definitely not a weak AI

50
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:27,080
since it can perform multiple tasks well

51
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,959
that's not really true when you ask

52
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,040
Alexa to play this besito it picks up

53
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:36,709
the key words play and dispose IDO and

54
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,990
runs a program and is trained - Alexa

55
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:41,570
cannot respond to a question it isn't

56
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:44,300
trained to answer for instance try

57
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:45,230
asking Alexa the status of traffic from

58
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,390
work to home

59
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:50,080
Alexa cannot provide you this

60
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:53,000
information as she is not trained - and

61
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:57,650
that brings us to our second category of

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,930
AI strong AI now this is much like the

63
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,350
robots that only exist in fiction as of

64
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,590
now

65
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:06,680
Ultron from Avengers is an ideal example

66
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:09,200
of a strong AI that's because it's

67
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,920
self-aware and eventually even develops

68
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,610
emotions

69
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:16,010
this makes the a eyes response

70
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:18,799
unpredictable you must be wondering well

71
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:20,810
how is artificial intelligence different

72
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:24,380
from machine learning and deep learning

73
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:27,350
we saw what a is machine learning is a

74
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:30,140
technique to achieve AI and deep

75
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:32,540
learning in turn is a subset of machine

76
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:34,370
learning machine learning provides a

77
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,410
machine with the capability to learn

78
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:39,170
from data and experience throughout

79
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:41,600
rhythms deep learning does this learning

80
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:44,120
through ways inspired by the human brain

81
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:47,030
this means through deep learning data

82
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,400
and patterns can be better perceived Ray

83
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:52,220
Kurzweil a well known futurist

84
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,459
predicts that by the Year 2045 we would

85
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:57,620
have robots as smart as humans this is

86
00:03:55,459 --> 00:04:01,280
called the point of singularity well

87
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:03,350
that's not all in fact Elon Musk

88
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,530
predicts that the human mind and body

89
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:10,280
will be enhanced by AI implants which

90
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:12,829
would make us partly cyborgs so here's a

91
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:17,030
question for you which of the below AI

92
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:20,030
projects don't exist yet a an AI robot

93
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:23,539
with citizenship be a robot with a

94
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:25,760
muscular skeletal system see a AI that

95
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:28,820
can read its owner's emotions

96
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:31,280
the AI that develops emotions over time

97
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:33,500
give it a thought and leave your answers

98
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,630
in the comments section below three

99
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,630
lucky winners will receive Amazon gift

100
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:41,840
vouchers since the human brain is still

101
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:45,050
a mystery it's no surprise that AI 2 has

102
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,660
a lot of unvented domains for now

103
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:50,840
AI is built to work with humans and make

104
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:53,360
our tasks easier however with the

105
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,850
maturation of technology we can only

106
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,230
wait and watch what the future of AI

107
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:00,290
holds for us

108
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:02,420
well that is artificial intelligence for

109
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,950
you in short do not forget to leave your
