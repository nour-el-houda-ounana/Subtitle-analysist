we come up with interesting tech videos

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,279
every day

13
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,920
so moving on here's the list of iot

14
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,160
projects

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,559
for 2020. first up is smart mirror

16
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,680
smart mirrors are a very cool iot

17
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,680
application

18
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,719
these mirrors can be used to display

19
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,840
temperature

20
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,480
news weather calendar clock

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,120
and complements on the screen apart from

22
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,360
these

23
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,559
smart mirrors can be used to click the

24
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,120
perfect selfies

25
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,800
with a built-in camera it can also be

26
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,440
installed with speakers

27
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,480
to play some music and they also provide

28
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,840
on-demand

29
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,359
workout sessions with world-class

30
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,800
trainers the mirror can be used to

31
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,359
browse the internet

32
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,720
make phone calls and even be connected

33
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,159
with other devices

34
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,119
for collaboration next up is smart money

35
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,840
transfer

36
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,240
we're heading towards complete

37
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,479
digitization

38
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,280
transactions are made possible on your

39
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,159
cell phone

40
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,280
with apps like apple pay google pay and

41
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,680
paypal

42
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,439
but imagine if you could walk to a store

43
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,159
and pay with the wrist watch

44
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,320
wouldn't that be cool the purpose of the

45
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,960
smart wallet is to provide an

46
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,240
easy and reliable platform for money

47
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,680
transactions

48
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,680
it is compact variable and rechargeable

49
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,560
for safety purposes the user

50
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,079
authenticity is validated the smart

51
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,399
money transfer technology

52
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,280
can reduce the burden of mobile money

53
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,119
transfer

54
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,479
when you're on the go you could easily

55
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,280
step into a store

56
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,520
purchase the goods and pay hassle free

57
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,680
after every successful transaction

58
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,680
the balance is updated immediately to

59
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,880
avoid any uncertainty

60
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,520
next up is iot based smart arm

61
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,560
now this project includes the creation

62
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,439
of a robotic

63
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,039
arm which can pick and place things from

64
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,920
one place to another

65
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,959
to control this action the robotic arm

66
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,000
can be moved using specific commands

67
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,080
some advanced arms allow the user to

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,800
change the end effect of the arm

69
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,000
to perform various different actions it

70
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,440
can be used to make

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,400
art print 3d images and build production

72
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,400
lines

73
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,920
it can also be used to perform your

74
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,680
day-to-day chores

75
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,480
at number 4 we have smart irrigation

76
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,840
now with change in climate and recurrent

77
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,239
water crisis

78
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,200
farmers suffer a great deal with growing

79
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,440
crops

80
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,560
smart irrigation puts an end to this

81
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,800
ordeal

82
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,599
this system comes with the moisture

83
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,360
sensor

84
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,840
that checks the soil for its water

85
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,440
content when the soil moisture drops

86
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,000
below a certain value

87
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,879
the system triggers the water supply at

88
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,440
number 5

89
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,319
we have smart door now as the name

90
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,959
suggests

91
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,599
this project aims at creating smart

92
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,159
doors

93
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,360
that control the entry and exit of

94
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,400
humans

95
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,360
these doors open and close automatically

96
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,080
when you pass by the door can also be

97
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,560
controlled

98
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,200
remotely you could unlock the door for a

99
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,159
friend

100
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,360
by tapping an icon on your smartphone

101
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,840
once they exit

102
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,959
you're immediately notified the owner

103
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,760
can also choose

104
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,480
who has the access to the door at number

105
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,519
6

106
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,599
we have air monitoring system now air

107
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,480
monitoring has become crucial for the

108
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,560
environment

109
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,400
and what better way to do it than

110
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,760
incorporating iot

111
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,720
the iot system uses air sensors to sense

112
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,159
the presence of

113
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,400
harmful gases or compounds in the air

114
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,680
the data collected can be used by the

115
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,640
local authorities

116
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,400
to make a detailed analysis necessary

117
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,879
actions can also be taken

118
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,879
to ensure that the air quality levels

119
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,360
don't reach an extreme low

120
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,560
especially in areas with hospitals and

121
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,360
schools

122
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,640
moving on to number seven we have smart

123
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,280
alarm clock

124
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,319
now there are many variations of a smart

125
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,959
alarm clock

126
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,560
but the alarm we are talking about is a

127
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,040
self-setting alarm

128
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,919
the smart alarm clock uses your google

129
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,919
calendar

130
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,080
to check your appointments to set the

131
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,880
alarm it can also procure

132
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,160
data from gps about your eta to a

133
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,000
particular place

134
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,800
and consider the weather to

135
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,120
automatically adjust your wake time

136
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,080
all of this is just making life more

137
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,120
easier

138
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,600
moving on at number eight we have iot

139
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,320
based

140
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,160
weather reporting system now the system

141
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,960
deals with monitoring weather

142
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,000
and climate changes like humidity

143
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,520
temperature

144
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,400
moisture wind speed uv radiation

145
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,520
light intensity and even carbon monoxide

146
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,240
levels in the air

147
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,759
using multiple sensors now these

148
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,080
installed sensors

149
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,880
send data to the web page that is

150
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,800
plotted as graphical statistics

151
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,600
the project even consists of an

152
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,400
application that sends notifications

153
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,800
as an effective alert to warn people

154
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,759
about

155
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,120
sudden and drastic weather changes so

156
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,360
when you're heading out

157
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,560
the app could easily tell you what the

158
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,720
weather will be like

159
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,639
and suggest carrying an umbrella or

160
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,160
perhaps a sunblock

161
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:31,520
at number nine we have smart wheelchair

162
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,160
there are over 132 million wheelchair

163
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,199
users

164
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,240
across the globe smart wheelchairs

165
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,320
is an excellent innovation typically it

166
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,120
comes with built-in sensors

167
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,160
on the seats that collect data every

168
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,320
second

169
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,400
the data provides insight into the

170
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,960
seating behavior of the patient

171
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,080
and the energy required to maintain the

172
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,800
posture

173
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,520
other variations of smart wheelchairs

174
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,639
could include

175
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,800
fall detection these features allow

176
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,560
people to monitor the patient from a

177
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,840
remote location

178
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,680
and finally at number 10 we have smart

179
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,240
street light system

180
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,120
this iot based street light monitoring

181
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,160
system

182
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,440
not only monitors but also ensures low

183
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,319
power consumption

184
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,560
and detects faulty lights the street

185
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,880
lights have external sensing

186
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,400
that automatically turns on at the

187
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,199
desired intensity

188
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,479
based on the lighting needed control of

189
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,720
light intensity

190
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,000
is based on the movement of people or

191
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,560
vehicles

192
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
in case of an emergency the lights

193
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,039
increase the brightness

194
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,680
to maximum intensity thereby ensuring

195
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,880
safety when deployed as a part of a

196
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,280
smart city

197
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,479
the users can be informed about any

198
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,800
outages

199
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,240
they can also register a complaint for

200
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,560
immediate service

201
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,280
so with that we come to the end of the

202
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,080
list

203
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,160
if you have any interesting projects let

204
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,880
us know in the comment section

205
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,319
so with that we end this short video on

206
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,319
iot projects

207
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,560
thank you so much for being here and

208
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,120

209
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:13,120
until then keep learning and stay tuned

210
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,120
to simply learn
