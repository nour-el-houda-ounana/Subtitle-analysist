00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,310
Dear Fellow Scholars, this is Two Minute Papers
with KÃ¡roly Zsolnai-FehÃ©r.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:10,000
In this project, OpenAI built a hide and seek
game for their AI agents to play.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,699
While we look at the exact rules here, I will
note that the goal of the project was to pit

4
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:20,590
two AI teams against each other, and hopefully
see some interesting emergent behaviors.

5
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,840
And, boy, did they do some crazy stuff.

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,580
The coolest part is that the two teams compete
against each other, and whenever one team

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,640
discovers a new strategy, the other one has
to adapt.

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,710
Kind of like an arms race situation, and it
also resembles generative adversarial network

9
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:39,710
a little.

10
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:45,589
And the results are magnificent, amusing,
weird - youâ€™ll see in a moment.

11
00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:50,960
These agents learn from previous experiences,
and to the surprise of no one, for the first

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,320
few million rounds, we start out withâ€¦pandemonium.

13
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,280
Everyone just running around aimlessly.

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,710
Without proper strategy and semi-random movements,
the seekers are favored and hence win the

15
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,340
majority of the games.

16
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,830
Nothing to see here.

17
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:13,120
Then, over time, the hiders learned to lock
out the seekers by blocking the doors off

18
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,300
with these boxes and started winning consistently.

19
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:21,870
I think the coolest part about this is that
the map was deliberately designed by the OpenAI

20
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:27,060
scientists in a way that the hiders can only
succeed through collaboration.

21
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,020
They cannot win alone and hence, they are
forced to learn to work together.

22
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,900
Which they did, quite well.

23
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,490
But then, something happened.

24
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,820
Did you notice this pointy, doorstop-shaped
object?

25
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,450
Are you thinking what I am thinking?

26
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:49,250
Well, probably, and not only that, but about
10 million rounds later, the AI also discovered

27
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:54,750
that it can be pushed near a wall and be used
as a ramp, and, tadaa!

28
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,750
Gotâ€™em!

29
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,470
Te seekers started winning more again.

30
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,640
So, the ball is now back on the court of the
hiders.

31
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,030
Can you defend this?

32
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,040
If so, how?

33
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,650
Well, these resourceful little critters learned
that since there is a little time at the start

34
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:18,230
of the game when the seekers are frozen, apparently,
during this time, they cannot see them, so

35
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:22,900
why not just sneak out and steal the ramp,
and lock it away from them.

36
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,790
Absolutely incredible.

37
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,130
Look at those happy eyes as they are carrying
that ramp.

38
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,190
And, you think it all ends here?

39
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,920
No, no, no.

40
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,080
Not even close.

41
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,470
It gets weirder.

42
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,810
Much weirder.

43
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:40,530
When playing a different map, a seeker has
noticed that it can use a ramp to climb on

44
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,160
the top of a box, and, this happens.

45
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,020
Do you think couchsurfing is cool?

46
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,400
Give me a break!

47
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,910
This is box surfing!

48
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:55,340
And, the scientists were quite surprised by
this move as this was one of the first cases

49
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,840
where the seeker AI seems to have broken the
game.

50
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,370
What happens here is that the physics system
is coded in a way that they are able to move

51
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,840
around by exerting force on themselves, but,
there is no additional check whether they

52
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,580
are on the floor or not, because who in their
right mind would think about that?

53
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,900
As a result, something that shouldnâ€™t ever
happen does happen here.

54
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,080
And, weâ€™re still not done yet, this paper
just keeps on giving.

55
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,319
A few hundred million rounds later, the hiders
learned to separate all the ramps from the

56
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,440
boxes.

57
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:37,520
Dear Fellow Scholars, this is proper box surfing
defenseâ€¦then, lock down the remaining tools

58
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,620
and build a shelter.

59
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:45,099
Note how well rehearsed and executed this
strategy is - there is not a second of time

60
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,280
left until the seekers take off.

61
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,879
I also love this cheeky move where they set
up the shelter right next to the seekers,

62
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,760
and I almost feel like they are saying â€œyeah
see this here?

63
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,170
there is not a single thing you can do about
itâ€�.

64
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:05,970
In a few isolated cases, other interesting
behaviors also emerged, for instance, the

65
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:11,160
hiders learned to exploit the physics system
and just chuck the ramp away.

66
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,560
After that, the seekers go â€œwhat?â€�

67
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,410
â€œwhat just happened?â€�.

68
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,840
But donâ€™t despair, and at this point, I
would also recommend that you hold on to your

69
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,940
papers because there was also a crazy case
where a seeker also learned to abuse a similar

70
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:31,889
physics issue and launch itself exactly onto
the top of the hiders.

71
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:34,580
Man, what a paper.

72
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,500
This system can be extended and modded for
many other tasks too, so expect to see more

73
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,860
of these fun experiments in the future.

74
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,430
We get to do this for a living, and we are
even being paid for this.

75
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,350
I canâ€™t believe it.

76
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:53,190
In this series, my mission is to showcase
beautiful works that light a fire in people.

77
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,140
And this is, no doubt, one of those works.

78
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:01,590
Great idea, interesting, unexpected results,
crisp presentation.

79
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,160
Bravo OpenAI!

80
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,160
Love it.

81
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,550
So, did you enjoy this?

82
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,830
What do you think?

83
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,690
Make sure to leave a comment below.

84
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:13,620
Also, if you look at the paper, it contains
comparisons to an earlier work we covered

85
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:19,650
about intrinsic motivation, shows how to implement
circular convolutions for the agents to detect

86
00:05:19,650 --> 00:06:03,110
their environment around them, and more.

87
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,310
Thanks for watching and for your generous
support, and I'll see you next time!
