bro hope you're doing well and in this

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,319
video i'm going to teach you guys about

4
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,320
polymorphism in java so

5
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,320
sit back relax and enjoy the show

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,759

help keep this channel running

10
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,640
polymorphism this is a greek word for

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,279
poly meaning many

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,439
and morph meaning form or forms it's the

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,840
ability of an object to identify

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,079
as more than one type think of it as

15
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,239
being identified as more than one

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,600
data type here's an example let's say

17
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,280
we're going to have a race

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,040
and we can enter in all different sorts

19
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,399
of vehicles into this race they don't

20
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,800
all have to be the same

21
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,079
so we have a few additional classes a

22
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,680
class called vehicle

23
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,760
vehicle is going to act as the parent

24
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,039
class for my class car

25
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,000
so car extends vehicle bicycle bicycle

26
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,280
extends vehicle

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,840
and boat boat extends vehicle so car

28
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,760
bicycle and boat are all subclasses or

29
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,199
children classes of the vehicle

30
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,520
superclass

31
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,320
so let's create an instance of our car

32
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,159
bicycle and

33
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,920
boat luckily through the magic of

34
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,680
copying and pasting i have done that

35
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,240
already we have a car object

36
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,119
a bicycle object and a boat object so

37
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,200
let's store

38
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,960
well at least attempt to store all of

39
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,680
these objects within an array called

40
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,280
racers

41
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,119
bracers equals and then we will place

42
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,840
our car

43
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,840
bicycle and boat within this array so

44
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,240
what's the data type of this array going

45
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,400
to be

46
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,240
well we're going to have a problem could

47
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,479
we make this cars

48
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,720
well we can store our car object within

49
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,079
an array of cars but not our bicycle and

50
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,920
our boat

51
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,600
the same thing goes for bicycle we can

52
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,240
store our bicycle but not the car in the

53
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,520
boat

54
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,880
and lastly with the boat data type we

55
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,600
can store the boat but not the car and

56
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,600
the bicycle

57
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,280
and to solve this issue we can use the

58
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,320
power of polymorphism

59
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,799
so for example our car identifies as a

60
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,200
car

61
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,520
but since it extends the vehicle class

62
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,840
it also identifies as a vehicle

63
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,040
same thing goes with our bicycle and our

64
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,719
boat so

65
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,479
one thing they all have in common is

66
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,479
that they are all vehicles

67
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,000
so we can change the data type of this

68
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,480
array to vehicles

69
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,200
and therefore we can store our car our

70
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,040
bicycle

71
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,319
and our boat because all of these

72
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,720
objects also

73
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,720
identify as vehicles so if you're going

74
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,959
to store objects within an array

75
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,480
and they're all different object types

76
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,040
you would have to find what they have in

77
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,520
common

78
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,239
and make an array of that type so that's

79
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,319
how to store

80
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,400
different objects within an array using

81
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,280
polymorphism and now for our wrists

82
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,280
we're going to call

83
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,120
a go method that we're going to define

84
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,599
within each of our classes car

85
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,959
bicycle and boat so let's begin with car

86
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,599
let's create a go method

87
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,720
so let's make this public void it's not

88
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,599
returning anything

89
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,560
and this will be called go so when we

90
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,560
call this method

91
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,920
all we'll do is have a print line

92
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,200
statement system.out.printline

93
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:00,800
let's say something like the car begins

94
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,480
moving okay let's repeat the process for

95
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,120
bicycle and boat

96
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:10,959
let's change car to bicycle

97
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,040
and within the boat class car to boat

98
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,159
so each of these methods well each of

99
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,640
these classes

100
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,800
has their own go method and we could

101
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:23,360
call them individually kind of like this

102
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:26,640
car.go bicycle.go

103
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,640
and boat.go

104
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,159
so this would work but there's actually

105
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,840
a better way to write this

106
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,680
and what would be better is if we were

107
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,360
to create an enhanced for loop to

108
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,120
iterate through all of the elements of

109
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,200
this array of vehicles

110
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,799
so the data type for this enhanced for

111
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,519
loop is going to be vehicle

112
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,200
we'll use x as our counter colon and

113
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,680
then the name of the array which is

114
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,200
racers so this is going to iterate once

115
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,519
through all of the elements of this

116
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,680
array of vehicles called racers

117
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,439
x represents the vehicle we are

118
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,080
currently working with

119
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,040
so x dot and we would like to use the go

120
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,040
method

121
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,480
so our enhanced for loop doesn't care

122
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,280
what kind of vehicle you are

123
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,840
if you're a car a bicycle or a boat it

124
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,519
cares

125
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,680
that you're a vehicle and if you're a

126
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,959
vehicle use your go method whatever kind

127
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,360
of vehicle you are

128
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,000
so there's one more step to this too the

129
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,079
method go

130
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,359
is undefined for the type vehicle so we

131
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,840
need to make sure we have

132
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,799
this go method within our class of

133
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,199
vehicle

134
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,320
and i just generated that here so what

135
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,160
we're doing is actually

136
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,600
method overriding within the car the

137
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,120
bicycle and the bulk class

138
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,199
so this isn't necessary but it's

139
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,440
considered good practice to add the

140
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,240
add override annotation to each of these

141
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,240
methods

142
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,000
and then our enhanced for loop is going

143
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,080
to iterate through all of the elements

144
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,240
of our array of vehicles called

145
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,199
racers so it doesn't care what kind of

146
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,120
vehicle you are

147
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,479
if you're a vehicle use your go method

148
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,040
well luckily our car

149
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,960
our bicycle and our boat all also

150
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,440
identify as a vehicle

151
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,080
so that's all that polymorphism is it's

152
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,320
the ability of an object to identify

153
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,800
as more than one type think of it as

154
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,600
identifying as more than one data type

155
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,520
our car does identify as a car but it

156
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,600
also identifies as a vehicle

157
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,800
same thing can be said with our bicycle

158
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,680
and our boat

159
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,039
but not only that all objects are

160
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,320
children classes of the

161
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:19,039
object class so they also identify as

162
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,800
objects so you could write this using

163
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,800
the object data type but there's a few

164
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,039
other changes that we would have to make

165
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,360
so that's all that polymorphism is it's

166
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,560
the ability of an object to identify as

167
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,919
more than one type

168
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,600
so if you would like a copy of all this

169
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,720
code i will post all of this in the

170
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,160
comments down below
