1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
hey everyone how's it going my name is

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,109
Mai you go today is a start of a brand

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,179
new series where I'm gonna teach you

4
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:11,460
about different technologies in under

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,650
two minutes we'll introduce concepts

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,049
explain things in an easy-to-understand

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,119
way and give you the foundation that you

8
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:25,380
need to dive deeper on your own

9
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:27,689
this is Tekken 2 so the inaugural topic

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,640
for today is front-end development and

11
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:31,410
we're gonna start the timer so we're

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,840
talking about websites there's a lot

13
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,640
that goes on in creating that site what

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,910
we typically call the front-end of a

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,579
website is the user interface aka the

16
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,070
text buttons images and views that you

17
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,260
see on the screen to interact with the

18
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,600
website or service so front-end

19
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,910
development is the practice of creating

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,440
those interactable interfaces the term

21
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,260
is mostly used to describe the

22
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,149
development of web interfaces but it can

23
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,309
be used to describe the development of

24
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,780
mobile and desktop interfaces as well

25
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,480
think about when you need to withdraw

26
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,460
some cash you don't just go up to a pile

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,560
of money and just grab whatever you can

28
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,750
because that would break all the rules

29
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,939
of banking the money you get is probably

30
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,920
someone else's and you're probably going

31
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:17,759
to get the wrong amount of money and

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,590
that's why we have ATMs ATMs acts as an

33
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,659
interface to make sure that you're only

34
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,210
pulling the money that you need from the

35
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,400
correct account so think of the ATM like

36
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,470
front-end development where it enables

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,500
users to interact with the data in a

38
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,210
safe and user-friendly way so what's in

39
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,770
the stack you might ask well there's

40
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,540
three main technologies that are used

41
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,270
for front-end development the first is

42
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,939
HTML which helps create the UI elements

43
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,649
on the screen the second is CSS which is

44
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,170
basically a set of rules that helps

45
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,960
define the style of a website including

46
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,659
things like font spacing and color and

47
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,250
then there's JavaScript which can also

48
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,590
create elements on the screen through

49
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,320
libraries it helps handle events that

50
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,149
are happening on-screen and it sends and

51
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,009
receives data from the backend and

52
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:03,899
lastly what are the important factors

53
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,119
when working on front-end development

54
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,310
the first is that tooling and

55
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,619
technologies are always changing so

56
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,819
front-end developers always need to stay

57
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:14,459
up to date with the newest

58
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:16,709
the second is creating a flexible and

59
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:18,959
easy-to-use interface that can be used

60
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:21,450
by anybody so making sure that it's

61
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,700
accessible and that the UI works on

62
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,370
different devices operating systems

63
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,959
browsers and screen sizes and the last

64
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,510
is to make sure that you can follow a

65
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,640
spec well by being visually detailed

66
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:35,069
oriented and collaborate and communicate

67
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,599
well with product managers and designers

68
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:38,909
and that's it

69
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,950
that's front-end development I hope you

70
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:42,719
liked this episode of tech into there's

71
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,280
gonna be another one about back-end

72
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,349
development which complements this one

73
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,939
really nicely so make sure to hit that
