00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
The Internet of Things or iot
is influencing our lifestyle

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,622
from the way we react

3
00:00:05,622 --> 00:00:08,200
to the way we behave.
From air conditioners

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,200
that you can control
with your smartphone

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,910
to Smart Cars providing
the shortest route

6
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,100
or your Smartwatch

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,600
which is tracking
your daily activities.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,325
IoT is a giant network

9
00:00:18,325 --> 00:00:21,600
with connected devices.
These devices gather

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,828
and share data about
how they are used

11
00:00:23,828 --> 00:00:26,600
and the environment
in which they are operated.

12
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,100
It's all done using sensors, 
sensors are embedded

13
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,846
in every physical device.

14
00:00:31,846 --> 00:00:35,200
It can be your mobile
phone, electrical appliances

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,100
Pecos barcode sensors

16
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,900
traffic lights and almost
everything that you come across

17
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,800
in day-to-day life. These sensors
continuously emit data

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,101
about the working state
of the devices,

19
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:48,905
but the important question is

20
00:00:48,905 --> 00:00:51,600
how do they share
this huge amount of data,

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,400
And how do we put this data

22
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,700
to our benefit iot
provides a common platform

23
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,700
for all these devices
to dump their data.

24
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,849
And a Common language

25
00:01:00,849 --> 00:01:04,656
for all the devices to
communicate with each other. Data

26
00:01:04,656 --> 00:01:06,854
is emitted from various sensors

27
00:01:06,854 --> 00:01:07,917
and sent to iot

28
00:01:07,917 --> 00:01:12,299
platform security iot platform
integrates the collected data

29
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:13,300
from various sources

30
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,174
further analytics is
performed on the data

31
00:01:16,174 --> 00:01:20,200
and valuable information
is extracted as per requirement.

32
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,000
Finally.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,280
The result is shared

34
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,800
with other devices for better
user experience Automation

35
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,500
and improving efficiencies.

36
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,500
Let us look at a scenario
where iot is doing wonders.

37
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,121
In an AC manufacturing industry
both the manufacturing machine

38
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:39,000
and the Belt have
sensors attached they

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,077
continuously send data
regarding the machine health

40
00:01:42,077 --> 00:01:43,800
and the production specifics

41
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,311
to the manufacturer
to identify issues beforehand.

42
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:48,806
A barcode is attached

43
00:01:48,806 --> 00:01:51,500
to each product
before leaving the belt.

44
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,853
It contains the product
code, manufacturer details,

45
00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:56,600
special instructions Etc.

46
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,700
The manufacturer uses
this data to identify

47
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,700
where the product

48
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,100
was distributed and track
the Retailer's inventory hence,

49
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,766
the manufacturer can make
the product running

50
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:08,060
out of stock available

51
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,413
Next this products
are packed and parcel

52
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:11,800
to different retailers.

53
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,300
Each retailer has

54
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,040
a barcode reader to track
the products coming

55
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,183
from different manufacturers,
manage inventory, check

56
00:02:19,183 --> 00:02:20,391
special instructions

57
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:22,120
and many more. The compressor

58
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,676
of air conditioner
has an embedded sensor

59
00:02:24,676 --> 00:02:28,000
that emits data regarding
its health and temperature.

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This data is not allies
continuously allowing

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,700
the customer care to contact you
for the repair work in time.

62
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,100
This is just one
of the million scenarios.

63
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,100
We have Smart appliances, Smart
Cars, Smart Homes, smart Cities

64
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,000
where iot is redefining
our lifestyle and transforming

65
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,400
the way we interact
with Technologies.

66
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,900
The future of iot industry is

67
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,400
huge. Business Insider
intelligence estimates

68
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,900
that 24 billion iot devices
will be installed by 2020

69
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,300
and ITC predicts

70
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,800
that iot Revenue will reach
around three hundred

71
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,600
and fifty seven billion

72
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,208
in 2019 resulting in a lot
of job opportunities

73
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:12,600
in the IT industry.
