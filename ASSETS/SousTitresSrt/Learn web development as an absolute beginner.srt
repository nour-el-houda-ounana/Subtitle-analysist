00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,090
If you want to learn web development, where 
do you even start? It's hard to find the right  

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:13,910
advice without suffering from information overload.
That's why I've created this beginner's roadmap!  

3
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:19,220
it lays out all the basics you need to learn 
web development we're going to go through each  

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,360
step so by the end of this guide you'll have an 
understanding of the basics of web development and  

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:32,570
what skills you need to learn I recommend doing 
steps 1 2 & 3 in order then depending on whether  

6
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:39,290
you want to focus on more front-end or back-end 
you can do steps 4A or 4B. I personally think  

7
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:43,070
it's a good idea for front-end web developers to 
learn at least a little bit of back-end and vice  

8
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,910
versa knowing the basics of both will help 
you know if you like front-end or back-end  

9
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:54,890
web development better sound good let's dig deeper 
into the roadmap before you get into actual coding  

10
00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:00,080
you'll need to understand some general concepts 
as you start your journey into web development how  

11
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:07,700
websites work the difference between front-end and 
back-end and using a code editor all websites at  

12
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,440
the most basic are just a bunch of files that are 
stored on a computer called a server this server  

13
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,450
is connected to the Internet you can then load 
that website through a browser like Chrome Firefox  

14
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:23,000
or Safari on your computer or on your phone 
your browser is also called the client in this  

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,390
situation so every time you're on the Internet 
you the client are loading data from the server  

16
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:34,310
as well as submitting data back to the server this 
back and forth between the client and the server  

17
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:41,990
is the basis of the internet web developer roles 
typically fall into three categories front end  

18
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:48,890
back end and full stack the terms front end back 
end and full stack web developer describe what  

19
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:53,590
part of the client-server relationship that you're 
working with fernand means that you're dealing  

20
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,880
mainly with the client-side it's called the front 
end because it's what you can see in the browser  

21
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,370
conversely the back end is the part of the website 
that you can't really see but it handles a lot of  

22
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:09,040
the logic and functionality that is necessary for 
everything to work one way you can think about  

23
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,420
this is that front-end web development is like 
the front-of-house part of a restaurant it's a  

24
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,730
section where customers come to see and experience 
the restaurant the interior decor seating and of  

25
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:23,920
course eating the food on the other hand back-end 
web development is like the back of house part of  

26
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,900
the restaurant it's where deliveries and inventory 
are managed and the process to create the food all  

27
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,220
happens there's a lot of things behind the scenes 
that the customers won't see they will experience  

28
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:39,520
and hopefully enjoy the end product a delicious 
meal fun illustrations aside both front-end and  

29
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,490
back-end web development serve different but very 
important functions when you build a website the  

30
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:50,980
most essential tool that you'll use is your code 
editor or IDE integrated development environment  

31
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:56,080
this tool allows you to write the markup and code 
that will make up the website there are quite a  

32
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,170
few good options out there but currently the most 
popular code editor is vs code vs code is a more  

33
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:08,830
lightweight version of Visual Studio Microsoft's 
main IDE it's fast free easy to use and you can  

34
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:14,800
customize it with themes and extensions other 
code editors are sublime text Adam and vim if  

35
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,120
you're just getting started though I'd recommend 
checking out vs code which you can download from  

36
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,310
their website now that we've covered some of the 
broader concepts of what web development is let's  

37
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:29,980
get into more of the details starting with the 
front end the front end of a website is made up  

38
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:38,470
of three types of files HTML CSS and JavaScript 
these files are what is loaded in the browser on  

39
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:45,010
a client-side HTML or hypertext markup language 
is the foundation of all websites it's the main  

40
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:50,290
file type that is loaded in your browser when you 
look at a web site the HTML file contains all the  

41
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:56,200
content on the page and it uses tags to denote 
different types of content for example you can use  

42
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:07,890
tags to create headline titles paragraphs bulleted 
lists images and so on HTML tags by themselves do  

43
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:12,030
have some Styles attached but they're pretty basic 
kind of like what you would see in a Word document  

44
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:19,980
CSS or cascading style sheets lets you style that 
HTML content so it looks nice and fancy you can  

45
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:26,100
add colors custom fonts and lay out the elements 
of your website however you want them to look  

46
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:33,180
you can even create animations and shapes with 
CSS there's a lot of depth to CSS and sometimes  

47
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,340
people tend to gloss over it so they can move 
on to things like JavaScript however it's really  

48
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:45,480
important to be able to convert a design into 
a front-end website layout using CSS javascript  

49
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,950
is a programming language that was designed to 
run in the browser using JavaScript you can make  

50
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:55,710
your website respond to different inputs from the 
user or other sources for example you can build a  

51
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,120
back to top button that when the user clicks it 
they'll scroll back up to the top of the page  

52
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:07,530
as we mentioned HTML CSS and JavaScript are the 
basic building blocks of front-end web development  

53
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:13,950
in addition to them there are a few other tools 
that you'll want to learn at this point package  

54
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:18,990
managers are online collections of software much 
of it open source each piece of software called  

55
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:24,030
a package is available for you to install and 
use in your own projects you can think about  

56
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:28,530
them like plugins instead of writing everything 
from scratch you can use helpful utilities that  

57
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:33,270
other people have written already for instance 
you can simply use a slider plug-in instead of  

58
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:38,400
having to code it all yourself which could take 
days to figure out why reinvent the wheel if you  

59
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:45,150
don't have to the most popular package manager is 
called NPM or node package manager you can also  

60
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:49,830
use another manager called yarn both are good 
options to know and use although it's probably  

61
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:55,500
best to start out with NPM in addition to package 
manager is you'll want to become familiar with  

62
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:01,230
build tools module bundlers and build tools are 
another essential part of the front-end workflow  

63
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:08,040
on a basic level these tools run tasks and process 
files you can use them to compile your sass files  

64
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:14,430
to CSS transpile your es6 javascript files down 
the es5 for better browser support run a local  

65
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:19,110
web server and many other helpful tasks saving 
you a ton of hassle if you were to try to do all  

66
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:24,000
these essential steps by yourself three tools 
that you'll continue to come across a lot are  

67
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,450
gulp web pack and parcel personally I like using 
gulp for my own front-end workflows where I just  

68
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:36,300
want to compile my sass and JavaScript files and 
not do too much else the last tool you'll need  

69
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:42,120
to learn about in this stage is version control 
version control also called source control is  

70
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,020
a system that keeps track of every code change 
that you make in your project files you can even  

71
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,610
revert to a previous chain if you make a mistake 
it's almost like having infinite save points for  

72
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:56,580
your projects and let me tell you it can be a huge 
lifesaver the most popular version control system  

73
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,770
is an open source system called git using git you 
can store all your files and then change history  

74
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:07,680
in collections called repositories you may also 
have heard of github which is an online hosting  

75
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:14,820
company owned by Microsoft where you can store 
all your git repositories at this point you've  

76
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,390
learned the basics of friend development and 
have a choice to either delve into additional  

77
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:23,520
friends skills or learn about basic backend web 
development with additional front-end there are  

78
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,570
some more intermediate skills that you will 
want to learn I recommend that you look at the  

79
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:34,620
following SAS responsive design and a JavaScript 
framework SAS is an extension of CSS that makes  

80
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:40,740
writing styles more intuitive and modular it's 
a really powerful tool with sass you can split  

81
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,630
up your styles into multiple files for better 
organization create variables to store colors and  

82
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:51,750
fonts and use mix-ins and placeholders to easily 
reuse styles even if you utilize just some of  

83
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,710
the basic features like nesting you'll be able to 
write your Styles quicker and with less headache  

84
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:03,300
responsive design ensures that your sales will 
look good on all devices desktops tablets and  

85
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,730
mobile phones the core practices of responsive 
design include using flexible sizing for elements  

86
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:15,300
as well as utilizing media queries to target 
styles for specific devices and widths for example  

87
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,880
instead of setting your contents to be a static 
400 pixels wide you can use a media query and set  

88
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:28,020
the content to be 50% width on desktop and 100% 
on mobile building a website with responsive CSS  

89
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:35,220
is a must these days especially as mobile traffic 
is outpacing desktop traffic in many cases once  

90
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:39,960
you have the basics of vanilla JavaScript down you 
may want to learn one of the JavaScript frameworks  

91
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,670
especially if you want to be a full-stack 
JavaScript developer these frameworks come with  

92
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,720
pre-built structures and components that allow 
you to build apps quicker than if you started  

93
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:56,310
from scratch currently you have three main choices 
react angular and view react which is technically  

94
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:02,160
a library was created by Facebook and is the most 
popular framework right now angular was the first  

95
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,840
big framework and it was created by Google it's 
still very popular even though it's been surpassed  

96
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:13,140
by react recently and views a newer framework 
created by Evan you a former angular developer  

97
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:18,480
well it is smaller news and react and angular is 
growing quickly and is also considered easy and  

98
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,290
fun to use you might be wondering now okay well 
which framework is the best the truth is they are  

99
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:30,870
all good and web development there's almost never 
a single choice that is 100% the best choice for  

100
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:36,690
every person in every situation your choice will 
most likely be determined by your job or it simply  

101
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:42,630
by which one you enjoy using the most if your end 
goal is to land a job at a company try researching  

102
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:47,640
which framework seems to be the most common in 
potential job listings don't worry too much about  

103
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,050
which framework to choose it's more important that 
you learn and understand the concepts behind them  

104
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:57,570
and once you learn one framework it'll be much 
easier to learn other ones after that let's move  

105
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:04,950
on now to our last section backend web development 
the backend or server side of web development is  

106
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:09,960
made up of three main components the server 
a server-side programming language and the  

107
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,610
database as we mentioned at the very beginning 
the server is the computer where all website  

108
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:20,280
files the database and other components are stored 
traditional servers run on operating systems such  

109
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:26,220
as Linux or Windows they're considered centralized 
because everything the website files back-end code  

110
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:32,970
and data are stored all together on the server 
nowadays there are also serverless architectures  

111
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:38,610
which is a more decentralized type of setup this 
type of application splits up those components and  

112
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:43,470
leverages third-party vendors to handle each 
of them despite the name though you still do  

113
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:48,060
need some kind of webserver to at least store 
your website files some examples of service  

114
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:54,450
providers are AWS Amazon Web Services or nullify 
Cir furless set ups are popular because they are  

115
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:58,860
fast cheap and you don't need to worry about 
server maintenance they're great for simple  

116
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,200
static websites that don't require a traditional 
server-side language however for very complex  

117
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:10,530
applications the traditional server setup might 
be a better option on the server you need to use  

118
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:15,120
a programming language to write the functions 
and logic for your application the server then  

119
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,520
compiles your code and conveys the result back 
to the client popular programming languages for  

120
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:28,080
the web include PHP Python Ruby c-sharp and Java 
there is also a form of server-side JavaScript  

121
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:34,320
node.js which is a runtime environment that 
can run JavaScript code on the server finally  

122
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,870
you'll need to learn about databases databases as 
a name implies are where you store information on  

123
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:46,290
your server for your website most databases use a 
language called SQL pronounced sequel which stands  

124
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:51,990
for structured query language in the database 
data is stored in tables sort of like complex  

125
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:59,550
Excel documents then you can write queries in SQL 
in order to create read update and delete data the  

126
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:04,200
database is run on the server meeting servers
